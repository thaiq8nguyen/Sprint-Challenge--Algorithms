#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This is an example of a polynomial O(n) since the loop runs n time


b) j increases as 2^n while an outside loop of n so it is a n log n


c) This is a recursion algorithm, the number of times the function calls itself increase as the number of bunnies increases so it is a linear O(n)

## Exercise II

This is a search problem looking for the value of f-floor so the number of eggs drop is minimize.

I would think the floor and broken eggs is a dictionary below
{"floor_1", 5, "floor_2": 8, ...}

My strategy is to use a binary search to look for the floor number
